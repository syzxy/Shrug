# Shrug
A subset of Git implemented in Shell Script.

## How to use
**Don't...**

It's a project for my master course COMP9044 Software Construction at UNSW, I had been working with git but I did not understand nor care what was going on under the hood until after implementing this program. **BUT** it is by no means complete or tested thoroughly for real usage.

Incase that anyone ever sees this and is interested, feel free to play with it :) and hopefully it'll gain you a better understanding of git internal as it did to me.

All files are located in [src](./src), clone or download a zip, then on a linux terminal:
```
cd src/
chmod 755 *.sh
```
The shrug (**sh**ell-**ru**ning-**g**it) workflow is similar to git, except of course the commands that are not implemented and there is not a shrughub...
